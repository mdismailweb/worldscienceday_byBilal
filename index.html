        World science day

    <p>
      Celebrated every 10 November, World Science Day for Peace and Development
      highlights the important role of science in society and the need to engage
      the wider public in debates on emerging scientific issues. It also
      underlines the importance and relevance of science in our daily lives.
      <br />
      By linking science more closely with society, World Science Day for Peace
      and Development aims to ensure that citizens are kept informed of
      developments in science. It also underscores the role scientists play in
      broadening our understanding of the remarkable, fragile planet we call
      home and in making our societies more sustainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The role of science in shaping our collective future can only be fulfilled
      when there is trust in science. It is trust in science that fuels the
      development and application of evidence-based solutions to our world’s
      multifaceted challenges. Trust in science is a complex issue. It affects
      the way in which scientists operate and the way science is perceived by
      society. Also, enhancing trust in science strengthens science-based policy
      decisions and society’s support for their application.
    </p>
    <p>
      This high-level roundtable aims to explore the parameters contributing to
      building and preserving trust in science.

      The role of science in shaping our collective future can only be fulfilled

      society. Also, enhancing trust in science strengthens science-based policy
      decisions and society’s support for their application.
      <br />
      The roundtable will offer an opportunity to discuss the links between
      science, policy, society, and science-based policy making, and to gain a
      better understanding of the status of scientific research. It will also
      highlight the importance of freedom and safety of scientists, as a key
      ingredient for science ecosystems driven by universal values, and the
      vital role of science popularization in enhancing scientific literacy,
      public awareness and trust in science.
      <br />
      These principles are laid down in two UNESCO standard-setting instruments:
      the Recommendation on Science and Scientific Researchers (2017) and the
      Recommendation on Open Science (2021). These instruments articulate a
      vision where science ecosystems are driven by universal values and aim at
      making science and its benefits accessible to all.
      <br />
      The event will close with the ceremony of the UNESCO Kalinga Prize for the
      Popularization of Science.
